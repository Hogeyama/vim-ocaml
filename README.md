# vim-ocaml

Vim runtime files for OCaml. These are the default runtime files with vim plus
a couple of extra changes lifted from Markus Mottl's repository. There's also a
few of my own additions. Such as an `:Opam` command to switch compilers inside
of vim. Also oasis syntax files.

## Installation

```
